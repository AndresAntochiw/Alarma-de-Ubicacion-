### **Product Evolution Stage 3**

At this stage, we’re focused on delivering the final version of our product, since it’s now time to hand it over to the client. All the documentation such as the refinement of **artifacts** and **user stories**, the **UML diagram**, and so on has already been completed. We then began coding, using the concepts we established and following the diagram. The program has now been finished and is fully ready for the client.

### **Main changes**

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Abstraction Process** |The class diagram was finally completed, showing clear improvements over the previous version, such as better-defined classes and an updated iteration of the CD (Class Diagram). |
| **Requirement Correspondence (FR/NFR)** |The methods used to verify the functional and non-functional requirements were integrated, and we now have the artifacts that confirm that both the FRs and NFRs were successfully verified.|
| **MVC Implementation** | The **MVC** design pattern was partially or fully applied, with defined packages for **Model**, **Controller**, and **View**. An optional data access layer is also considered. |
| **Requirement Refinement** | The number of functional requirements was reduced (from 16 to 9) and non-functional requirements (from 11 to 5), removing redundancies and reinforcing accounting traceability, security, and compatibility. |
| **Process Adjustments** | The internal organization was adapted after team member changes, maintaining coherence and continuity in the workflow. |


El diagrama de clases fue finalmente terminado, este teniendo una mejora con respecto a su version pasada, como las clases mejor definidas y la iteración sobre CD (Diagrama de clases).

Se integraron los metodos con los cuales permitieron la verificación de los RF y RNF y se cuenta con los artefactos que confirman que si se lograron verificar los RF y RNF.
